# This script copies the downloaded ImmPort FCS files to the appropriate folders for data analysis and renames them to the original FCS file names. 
# This is necessary in order to perform the rest of the downstream analyses.
# Before you run this script, download the result files for study SDY1680 from ImmPort (https://www.immport.org/home).
# As of 20210208, these FCS files are on ImmPort under `Browse Shared Data > SDY1680 > ResultFiles (569 files)` https://browser.immport.org/browser?path=SDY1680.
# This will download both the ICS and surface marker panel FCS files, including compensation files.
# The download process using Aspera will take a while (18.3 GB, took me 2 hrs and 42 min)
