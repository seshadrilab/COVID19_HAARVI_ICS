# 1) Ideally, run this script from your terminal, i.e. NOT in RStudio, to take full advantage of parallel computation.
# The rest of the pipeline can and should be run in RStudio.
# 
# One way to do this is to open your terminal and navigate to the top level of the project folder, start up R in interactive mode,
# and paste in the contents of this script.
# 
# Or run: R CMD scripts/20200612_RunCompass.R
# If you are using Unix/macOS, multicore processing (efficient forked/shared memory) only works when run from the terminal.
# Windows does not support forking.
# See: future::supportsMulticore()
# 
# 2) It's also a good idea to log the run: type "script out/CompassOutput/COMPASS_log.txt" in your terminal prior to running R.
# The COMPASS stdout and stderr will then get printed into COMPASS_log at the end of the furrr::future_pmap loop.
# Then after you quit R, type "exit" to close the log.
